# Calibration-Curve

This was created to automate the analysis of the calibration curve as well as automate the plotting of the data and assigning the arrows and letters for each dosage added at the correct location. This data was acquired for a bioanalysis research group that I joined for summer 2016.

Calibration Curve Data Input's excel file is the file that holds all the data samples acquired from a potentiostat and then the user would input all values in columns H through J aswell as cells E2,E3 and E4. The Calibration_Curve matlab file would then analysis these values and data points to create the current vs time plot with automated arrows and letters for each spot that a dosage was added as well as the calibration curve to show how the concentration of the dosage affected the current.
